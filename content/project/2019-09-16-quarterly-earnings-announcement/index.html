<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This paper aims to illustrate the different patterns of the shock effects, attributed to quarterly earnings announcement, among grouped stocks daily returns. The empirical study finds that, in Chinese A-share markets, the release of corporate earnings indeed produce significant abnormal returns, which are not captured by the Fama-French three factor model . It is worth noting that the group membership of stocks in the sample are data-determined, relying on an iterative algorithm called PLS from Su(2016). In the regression, We impose penalty on the market risk factor, beta, the firm level heterogeneous coefficients in CAPM.</p>
